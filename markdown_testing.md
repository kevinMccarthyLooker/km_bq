- Understand how the Legacy tool fits into the organizations Data Architecture strategy plans and how the Looker implementation will impact any business process (described in more detail below). Potential scenarios include:

  - Legacy Tool will continue to have enhancements or changes applied, and Looker development requirements will need to stay in sync/parity

  - Legacy Tool is not fully going away, and will need to co-exist with or integrate with the new looker implementation

- Prioritize the specific legacy assets and core capabilities that need to be migrated to Looker.

- In some cases, different parts of the Legacy Tool need to be handled with different levels of legacy-matching (described in project types below).  Ensure that the team knows which portions of a Legacy Tool may/should have more/less departure from legacy, and if any legacy features may be de-prioritized for replication, are untrusted, etc.

- Capture any deadlines that need to accounted for relating to the legacy tool including, for example:

  - A need to make the transition by the legacy tool licensing expiration date

  - When access will be granted to specific Data Sources

- Will the team members working on the engagement have adequate access to legacy system SMEs?

- Define a QA process for Unit Testing any assets built by comparing them to the Legacy Tools. See more Data Validation Process

- Document any challenges or risks to the process based on Legacy Tool specifics.
